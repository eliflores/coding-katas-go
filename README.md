   * Checkout the version of `golangci-lint` to use in the [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
7. Write the tests, write the code, lint the code, and have fun!
8. Open a Pull Request, wait for all the checks to pass, and merge! :tada:

âœ¨ **Note** âœ¨: A [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) file is available, so you could also 
work on a [Visual Studio Code Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) without the need to install `go` or `golangci-lint` on your local host.
